# cis357Project
When importing the project from a remote repository, the best practice is starting a new project with Android studio and selecting "Import from Version Control". 
With this option selected, Android Studio will be able to recognize the gradle settings, project file structure and select a target to run the application on.

You will also need to replace the API key located in MainActivity.kt
