# Location and Context APIs: Parking App

When importing the project from a remote repository, the best practice is starting a new project with Android studio and selecting "Import from Version Control". 
With this option selected, Android Studio will be able to recognize the gradle settings, project file structure and select a target to run the application on.

This is a Parking app that allows the user to get their current location (coordinates and address), save their location in their History, copy their coordinates to their device clipboard, and open their location in Google Maps. Tapping a history entry on the History screen also opens that entry's location in Google Maps. Remembering where you parked is unnecessary when you're able to save your precise location and open it in maps at any time.

This app is meant to demonstrate Google Play Services' Fused Location Provider and Google's Places API.
